\usage{
dash(comp_data, concentration = NULL, mode = NULL, optmethod = c("mixEM",
  "w_mixEM", "mixIP"), sample_weights = NULL, verbose = FALSE, bf = TRUE,
  pi_init = NULL, squarem_control = list(), dash_control = list(),
  reportcov = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{comp_data, }{a n by m matrix where n represents the sample and m
represents the category of composition.}

\item{concentration}{a vector of concentration scales for different Dirichlet
compositions. Defaults to NULL, in which case, we append
concentration values of Inf, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5
and 0.1.}

\item{mode}{An user defined mode/mean for the Dirichlet components. Defaults
to equal means for all components.}

\item{optmethod}{The method for performing optimization of the mixture
proportions or grades of memberships for the different
Dirichlet compositions. Can be either of "mixEM", "w_mixEM"
or weighted mixEM and "mixIP" for interior point convex
optimization.}

\item{sample_weights}{The weights of the samples for performing the optimization.
Defaults to NULL, in which case the weight is same for each sample.}

\item{verbose}{if TRUE, outputs messages tracking progress of the method.}

\item{bf}{A boolean (TRUE/FALSE) variable denoting whether log bayes factor
(with respect to category with smallest representation) is used in
optimization or the loglikelihood. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{pi_init}{An initial starting value for the mixture proportions. Defaults
to same proportion for all categories.}

\item{squarem_control}{A list of control parameters for the SQUAREM/IP algorithm,
default value is set to be control.default=list(K = 1, method=3,
 square=TRUE, step.min0=1, step.max0=1, mstep=4, kr=1,
 objfn.inc=1,tol=1.e-07, maxiter=5000, trace=FALSE).}

\item{dash_control}{A list of control parameters for determining the concentrations
and prior weights and fdr control parameters for dash fucntion.}

\item{reportcov}{A boolean indicating whether the user wants to return
the covariance and correlation structure of the posterior.
Defaults to FALSE.}

\description{
Given a matrix of compositional counts data, with samples along
the rows and the categories of composition along columns, performs Bayesian
adaptive shrinkage of the compositions to produce refined composition probs.
}
\details{
The dash function provides a number of ways to perform
Empirical Bayes shrinkage estimation on compositional data (counts).

The inputs to dash is a matrix of compositional counts with samples along
rows and categories along columns. The method assumes that the compositional
counts data is generated from an underlying composition probability vector,
which follows a mixture of Dirichlet distributions centered at the
user defined mode (which defaults to means for all categories being equal).

We assume that the component Dirichlet distributions in the mixture have varying
degrees of concentration, varying from Inf (which is same as saying a point mass
at the mode), and then from high to low values of concentration and even concentration
values less than 1, which would represent spikes at the corners of the simplex.

The grades of memberships/ mixture proportions in different Dirichlet
components are estimated and post-hoc measures - posterior mean, posterior weights,
posterior center and corner probabilities etc are computed. The posterior mean
is considered as the shrunk compositional probability.
